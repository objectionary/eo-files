**This repository is deprecated! We've moved all EO objects from this repository
to [objectionary/eo](https://github.com/objectionary/eo).**

[EO](https://www.eolang.org) objects for file system.

This is how you list all text files in a directory recursively:

```
each. > @
  filteredi.
    QQ.collections.list
      walk.
        QQ.fs.dir "/tmp"
        "**/*"
    [f i]
      and. > @
        f.is-dir.not
        matches.
          compile.
            QQ.txt.regex
              "/.*\\.txt$/"
          f
  [f]
    QQ.io.stdout > @
      QQ.txt.sprintf "file: %s\n" f
```

You are welcome to add more primitives to this lib.

Simple manipulations:

```
# Make a new object representing a file on disc
QQ.fs.file > f
  "/tmp/foo.txt"

# Get its name:
QQ.io.stdout
  QQ.txt.sprintf
    "File name is: %s"
    f

# Does it exist?
f.exists

# Is it a directory?
f.is-dir

# Touch it, to make sure it exists
f.touch

# Delete the file:
f.rm

# Rename/move it:
f.mv "/tmp/bar.txt"

# Get the size of it in bytes:
f.size > s
```

Reading:

```
# Read binary content into the "output," in 1024-bytes chunks;
# the "memory-as-output" is an abstract object with one free attribute,
# which is the memory where the bytes will be stored:
QQ.fs.file "/tmp/foo.txt" > f
memory > m
QQ.io.copied
  f.as-input
  QQ.io.memory-as-output m
  1024
```

Writing:

```
# Write binary content, taking it from the "input",
# until input turns into a non-empty "bytes"; here the
# "mode" is the same as the mode in POSIX fopen();
# if the file is absent, it will be created:
QQ.fs.file "/tmp/foo.txt" > f
QQ.io.copied
  QQ.io.bytes-as-input
    "你好, world!".as-bytes
  f.as-output "w+"
```

Smart object to help read content fast:

```
# This is the entire binary content of the file:
QQ.fs.content f
```

Directories:

```
# Make an object representing a directory on disc:
QQ.fs.directory > d
  "/tmp"

# Make it if doesn't exist:
d.mkdir

# Delete it recursively:
d.rm-rf

# List all files recursively:
d.walk "**/*.txt"
```

Temporary files:

```
# This is a system directory for temporary files:
QQ.fs.tmpdir > d

# Create an empty temporary file in a directory
d.tmpfile.@ > f
```

Name manipulations:

```
# Add path segment to existing file:
QQ.fs.file "/tmp" > f
f.resolve "foo.txt"

# Get directory name:
QQ.fs.dir-name f

# Get base name (no directory, not extension):
QQ.fs.base-name f

# Get extension:
QQ.fs.ext-name f
```
